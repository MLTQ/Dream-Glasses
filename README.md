# Dream Machine

The Dream Machine is a device that was first developed in the 1960s by artist Brion Gysin and engineer Ian Sommerville. It consisted of a paper tube placed on a record player, with an incandescent light inside. When the record player was turned on, the tube would spin, causing the light to flicker and cast patterns on the walls of a room.

The Dream Machine was inspired by Gysin's discovery of the "stroboscopic effect," which refers to the phenomenon of the brain perceiving a series of rapidly flashing lights as a single, moving image. Gysin and Sommerville believed that the Dream Machine could be used as a tool for inducing altered states of consciousness, and they used it as a basis for their own explorations of the mind.

# Dream Glasses

I was first introduced to the work of Brion Gysin through the Mysterious Universe podcast episode 28.23. I thought the idea behind the Dream Machine was very interesting, but I was put off by the exorbitant price of commercial brainwave entrainment devices such as the Lucia Light Device.

That's why I decided to create Dream Glasses, a cheap DIY project that allows you to experience the benefits of brainwave entrainment at home. It is a pair of glasses with LEDs that flicker at near frequencies of brainwave patterns, inducing brainwave entrainment to those frequencies, causing closed-eye visuals and other mental effects.

Dream Glasses is an easy to build project that requires minimal materials and tools. However, it does require a 3D printer and some light soldering. It is an affordable alternative to expensive commercial brainwave entrainment devices on the market. With Dream Glasses, you can explore your own mind and experience the benefits of brainwave entrainment in the comfort of your own home.

## How to build

The instructions for building Dream Glasses will be provided in the project's GitHub repository. It includes a list of materials and tools needed, as well as step-by-step instructions for assembling the device.

We hope that you will enjoy building and using the Dream Glasses as much as we did. Happy exploring!
