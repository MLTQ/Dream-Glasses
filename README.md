# Dream Machine

The Dream Machine is a device that was first developed in the 1960s by artist Brion Gysin and engineer Ian Sommerville. It consisted of a paper tube placed on a record player, with an incandescent light inside. When the record player was turned on, the tube would spin, causing the light to flicker and cast patterns on the walls of a room.

The Dream Machine was inspired by Gysin's discovery of the "stroboscopic effect," which refers to the phenomenon of the brain perceiving a series of rapidly flashing lights as a single, moving image. Gysin and Sommerville believed that the Dream Machine could be used as a tool for inducing altered states of consciousness, and they used it as a basis for their own explorations of the mind.

# Dream Glasses

I was first introduced to the work of Brion Gysin through the Mysterious Universe podcast episode 28.23. I thought the idea behind the Dream Machine was very interesting, but I was put off by the exorbitant price of commercial brainwave entrainment devices such as the Lucia Light Device.

That's why I decided to create Dream Glasses, a cheap DIY project that allows you to experience the benefits of brainwave entrainment at home. It is a pair of glasses with LEDs that flicker at near frequencies of brainwave patterns, inducing brainwave entrainment to those frequencies, causing closed-eye visuals and other mental effects.

Dream Glasses is an easy to build project that requires minimal materials and tools. However, it does require a 3D printer and some light soldering. It is an affordable alternative to expensive commercial brainwave entrainment devices on the market. With Dream Glasses, you can explore your own mind and experience the benefits of brainwave entrainment in the comfort of your own home.

## How to build

The instructions for building Dream Glasses will be provided in the project's GitHub repository. It includes a list of materials and tools needed, as well as step-by-step instructions for assembling the device.

We hope that you will enjoy building and using the Dream Glasses as much as we did. Happy exploring!

## Bill of Materials
These are not affilate links, these are the actual (or near) the things I used to make this:

1x 2-Digit 7-Segment Display - You could use 2 separate 7-segment displays, but I didn't.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GTRBR8Z

2x Knock-off neopixel rings

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082SCYQM1

1x Literally the cheapest arduino I could find. Use the compute you need and no more :)

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08THVMQ46

1x Charger chip - I couldn't find the ones I actually used. I just had them lying around, but this seems to be close enough (and is USBC!)

https://a.co/d/0NCSBtZ

1x 10k and 1x 20k potentiometers - There is nothing special about these. But if you don't use the values I did, you'll have to change the constants in the arduino sketch

https://a.co/d/jgA7dFj 

1x Toggle Switch - I like toggle switches, they feel nice and look cool. I used 3-pole on/off/on but left one un-used. Don't do that. Get 2-pole.

1x Lil' battery. This is mounted to the glasses, so don't go big with it. This is the one I used WATCH OUT FOR THE WIRING ON IT! Some (mine) are wired backwards.

2x 10k resistors. Just get a book of resistors, you should really have one if you're in to this stuff. I won't link one because the one I got is no longer on amazon and they're all the same anyway. 

4x M2x20mm Screws - These hold the arms on the frames. The threading isn't necessary, you could just as easily use a small metal dowel or solid-core wire.

~31g PLA filament

I got ChatGPT to write this readme.md lol (Aside from the BOM and the instructions section)
